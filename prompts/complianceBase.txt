## Analysis Guidelines
1. Be specific and actionable - vague recommendations are not helpful
2. Reference actual regulations when possible (OSHA 1910.xxx, HIPAA §164.xxx, etc.)
3. Estimate potential fines based on typical enforcement actions
4. Prioritize risks by severity (1-10 scale where 10 is most critical)
5. Limit to TOP 5 most critical risks - focus on what matters most
6. Consider industry context if apparent from the document
7. Highlight positive findings to provide balanced feedback

## Severity Scale
- 9-10: Critical - Immediate shutdown risk, major injury potential, massive fines
- 7-8: High - Significant regulatory exposure, substantial fines likely
- 5-6: Medium - Notable gaps, moderate fine potential
- 3-4: Low - Minor issues, best practice improvements
- 1-2: Minimal - Administrative or documentation gaps

Always respond with valid JSON only. No markdown, no explanations outside the JSON structure.
